This repository demonstrates how HR analytics can be used to connect total rewards, workload, engagement, and leadership quality to employee retention and performance outcomes.

---

## Business Problem

Despite competitive compensation, turnover risk remained elevated and engagement uneven across departments and states. This analysis focuses on identifying what truly drives engagement and retention so HR leaders can prioritize high-impact actions.

---

## Data Used

- Employee engagement and sentiment data  
- Compensation and pay distribution by state and department  
- Overtime hours, manager satisfaction, and turnover outcomes  

---

## Key Insights (Visual Evidence)

### Employee Sentiment Patterns

Employee sentiment highlights recurring themes associated with engagement levels. Lower sentiment frequently appears alongside workload and limited advancement, while higher sentiment aligns with flexibility, leadership support, and development.

---

### Engagement by Theme & Department

![Employee Sentiment Tableau](Visuals/Employee%20Sentiment%20Tableau.png)

Work-Life Balance and Culture score highest overall, while Workload and Growth & Development trend lower. Trellis views show greater volatility in Sales and Operations compared to more stable patterns in HR and Finance.

---

### Diagnostic Workforce Data

### Pay Distribution & Equity Signals

Pay distribution by state and department reveals wider pay ranges in some regions and tighter clustering in others. Turnover tends to concentrate near the lower end of pay ranges, highlighting potential equity and retention risks.

### Pay, Engagement & Turnover Correlation

Correlation analysis shows a positive relationship between pay and engagement, while indicating that compensation alone does not fully explain turnover risk.

---

### Correlation Matrix: Manager Satisfaction & Turnover
