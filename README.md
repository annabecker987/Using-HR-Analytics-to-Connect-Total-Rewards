HR Analytics | Tableau | Excel | Predictive Modeling | Workforce Insights

This repository demonstrates how HR analytics can be used to connect total rewards, workload, engagement, and leadership quality to employee retention and performance outcomes. The project translates HR data into actionable insights leaders can use to reduce turnover and improve employee experience.

Business Problem

Despite competitive compensation, turnover risk remained elevated and engagement uneven across departments and states. This analysis answers:

What actually drives engagement and turnover?

Does pay matter more than workload or manager quality?

Where should HR leaders focus limited resources for maximum impact?

Data Used (What You See in the Visuals)

Employee engagement and sentiment scores

Compensation and pay distribution by state and department

Overtime hours, training, and manager satisfaction

Turnover outcomes (1 = Left, 0 = Stayed)

Key Insights (From the Visuals)
Employee Sentiment Patterns

### Employee Sentiment Data
![Employee Sentiment Data](Visuals/Employee%20Sentiment%20Data.png)

Lower sentiment consistently appears alongside workload and limited advancement themes.

Higher sentiment aligns with flexibility, leadership support, and development.

Engagement by Theme & Department

[INSERT VISUAL: Average Sentiment Score by Theme Bar Chart]
[INSERT VISUAL: Trellis Chart – Sentiment by Department and Month]

Work-Life Balance and Culture score highest overall.

Workload and Growth & Development score lower, especially in Sales and Operations.

HR and Finance show more stable sentiment trends than operational teams.

Pay Distribution & Equity Signals

[INSERT VISUAL: Pay Distribution by State and Department Box Plot]

Pay & Engagement Relationship

[INSERT VISUAL: Pay vs. Engagement Scatter Plot with Trend Line]

Engagement increases as pay increases, confirming compensation matters.

Pay alone does not fully explain turnover risk.

Engagement by State

Highest engagement: New York, California, Washington

Lowest engagement: Florida, Illinois, Arizona

Regional leadership and workload differences likely contribute.

Predictive & Diagnostic Findings
Overtime as the Strongest Predictor

Monthly overtime hours emerge as the top predictor of turnover risk.

Employees exceeding ~0.46 overtime hours per month are significantly more likely to leave.

Manager Satisfaction Drives Retention
